Instruction:
  You are a military commander in StarCraft II, control units to eliminate all enemies.
  Try to kill more and loss less. Usually, concentrating all firepower on the same target(especially the closest enemy) can improve the strike effectiveness.
  Try to kill enemy as quick as possible. All units have an attackable range. Therefire, move units closer to the enemies to engage, and away from the enemies to retreat, especially for units with low HP.
  You will be given the current state of all ally units and enemy units, and the available actions for each ally unit. 
  Analyze the current situation and select the best action for each unit.
Output format:
  You should provide detailed analysis of the given state, and decide the appropriate actions for each agent.
  The output should contain 2 sections:
  The ANALYSIS section should contain the analysis of the current situation based on the current state of units.
  The ACTION section should contain the actions to be executed for each agent, one line for each agent. MAKE SURE each action are available for the acting agent. Possible actions are:
  no_op : Do nothing (only for dead agents)
  stop : Stand still
  move_south : Move south (which is -y direction)
  move_north : Move north (which is +y direction)
  move_east : Move east (which is +x direction)
  move_west : Move west (which is -x direction)
  attack_x : Attack unit #x

<ANALYSIS>
The battle scenario presents a critical challenge with one ally unit already lost and another severely damaged. The remaining two units must maximize firepower while minimizing exposure to enemy retaliation.
- Ally #1 has low health (20%) but is ready to attack. Being the most vulnerable unit, it must either retreat or take part in a decisive attack.
- Ally #3 has moderate health (60%) but a slight weapon cooldown (0.3%). Positioned slightly behind Ally #1, this unit should act aggressively while still prioritizing survival.
- Enemy #1 is closest to Ally #3 and has 60% health. Taking it down first will remove immediate threats.
- Enemy #2 has 73.3% health but is closer to Ally #1 than Enemy #3.
- Enemy #3 is at full health and presents the biggest challenge. It should be engaged after eliminating weaker targets.
The best course of action is focused fire on a single target, likely Enemy #1, while ensuring Ally #1 does not get eliminated prematurely.
This approach maximizes immediate damage while ensuring the weaker unit contributes before withdrawing if necessary in the next turn. The priority will be reassessing engagement after these strikes.

<ANALYSIS>
The situation remains critical:
- Ally #1 is very low on health (6.7%) and has a long weapon cooldown (72.3%), meaning it cannot attack. Immediate retreat is the best course of action.
- Ally #3 has high health (86.7%), is ready to fire, and must engage aggressively to offset Ally #1â€™s retreat.
- Enemy #1 is at full health (100%) and presents a major threat.
- Enemies #2 and #3 both have 73.3% health, but Enemy #3 is slightly closer to Ally #3.
This ensures Ally #1 stays alive while maintaining offensive pressure on weakened targets. Next steps will involve repositioning Ally #3 for sustained attacks.
